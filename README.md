# Roblox-PS4-Controller-Icons
Just changes the xbox icons for roblox into playstation ones

Feel free to ajust them to your liking, i suck at icon creation so i reccomend editing them

To Install:
Go to C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Roblox\Versions\LATESTVERSION\content\textures\ui\Settings\Help and paste it there
